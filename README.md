Coding is my hobby💖, and I'm specialize in mechanics currently.  

My personal website  (on developing) : [hellofriedparrot.club](https://hellofriedparrot.club/), and this is also an open-source blog platform!

That's my main languages for programming :

- 🐍 Python (website backend, mysql, machine learning, fem)   
- C/C++ (stm32, simple algorithms)
- MATLAB 
- C#
- Visual Basic (But don't like using this for developing)
- ❌ I don't use JAVA  

Also : 
- Typescript 
- Vue (for website)
